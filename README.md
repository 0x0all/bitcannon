# BitCannon
A torrent site mirroring tool

## About
The goal of BitCannon is to provide the tools to easily mirror the content of many torrent sites.

## How to use
Using BitCannon should be simple. First, install MongoDB for your platform. Then clone the repo and type `go build` or just download a prebuilt binary. Run bitcannon for options.

## Progress
The early version of BitCannon aims to provide import functionality from bittorrent archives and a simple interface to browse and search your torrent database. Later versions may have more advanced features like auto updating torrent indexes and possibly more.

## License
This is MIT licensed, so do whatever you want with it. Just don't blame me for anything that happens.
